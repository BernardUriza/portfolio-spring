## 2. üîí Set up Production Environment Approval

### Backend (portfolio-spring)

**Step 1: Navigate to Environments**
```
https://github.com/BernardUriza/portfolio-spring/settings/environments
```

Or: **Settings** ‚Üí **Environments** (left sidebar)

**Step 2: Create Production Environment**

1. Click **"New environment"** (green button)

**Step 3: Configure Protection Rules**

**‚úÖ Required Reviewers:**
- Check ‚òëÔ∏è **"Required reviewers"**
- Click search field
- Select yourself: **@BernardUriza**
- You can add up to 6 reviewers
- At least 1 must approve before deployment

**‚è±Ô∏è Wait Timer (Optional):**
- Check ‚òëÔ∏è **"Wait timer"**
- Enter minutes (e.g., `5`)
- Adds cooldown before deployment starts
- Useful for production safety

**üåø Deployment Branches:**
- Check ‚òëÔ∏è **"Deployment branches"**

   ```

These override repository secrets for production deployments only.

**Step 5: Environment Variables (Optional)**

1. Scroll to **"Environment variables"**
2. Click **"Add variable"**
3. Example:
   ```
   Name: ENVIRONMENT
   Value: production

### Frontend (portfolio-frontend)

**Repeat the same steps:**
```
https://github.com/BernardUriza/portfolio-frontend/settings/environments
```

1. Create environment: `production`
2. Add required reviewer: @BernardUriza
3. Set deployment branches: `main` or `prod`
4. Save protection rules

## 3. üß™ Test Complete Pipeline

### Option A: Test with Develop Branch

#### Backend Test

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd /Users/bernardurizaorozco/Documents/portfolio-spring

git checkout -b develop main

# Make a small test change
echo "\n# CI/CD Pipeline Test - $(date)" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Trigger staging deployment pipeline"
git push origin develop
```

**Expected Result:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
2. All jobs run: tests ‚Üí build ‚Üí quality ‚Üí security
3. `deploy-staging` job executes
4. Render receives webhook and deploys to staging
5. Slack notification sent (if configured)

**View Progress:**
```
https://github.com/BernardUriza/portfolio-spring/actions
```

#### Frontend Test

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd /Users/bernardurizaorozco/Documents/portfolio-frontend

# Create develop branch
git checkout -b develop prod

# Make test change
echo "\n# CI/CD Pipeline Test - $(date)" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Trigger staging deployment pipeline"
git push origin develop

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Save this immediately** - you'll need it for GitHub

---

### Step 3: Add Webhook to GitHub Secrets

**Backend:**
```
https://github.com/BernardUriza/portfolio-spring/settings/secrets/actions
```

**Frontend:**
```
https://github.com/BernardUriza/portfolio-frontend/settings/secrets/actions
```

**Create secret:**
```

---

### Step 4: Test Slack Notifications

**Manual Test (Optional):**

```bash
# Test the webhook directly
curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "text": "üß™ Test notification from CI/CD setup",
    "blocks": [
      {
        "type": "section",
        "text": {

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Secret not working

**Problem**: Workflow can't access secret

**Solution**:

2. Secret value has no trailing spaces
3. Re-create secret if needed
4. Check workflow syntax: `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

---

### Deployment fails

**Problem**: Render/Netlify deployment fails

**Solution**:
1. Verify deploy hook URL is correct
2. Check Render/Netlify dashboard for errors
3. Ensure service is active and not paused
4. Test deploy hook manually with curl

---

### No approval prompt

**Problem**: Production deploys without approval

**Solution**:
1. Verify environment name matches exactly: `production`
2. Check workflow uses: `environment: production`
3. Ensure protection rules are saved
4. Branch must match deployment branch rule

---

### Slack notifications not received

**Problem**: No Slack messages

**Solution**:
1. Verify webhook URL is correct
2. Test webhook with curl (see Step 4)
3. Check Slack app is installed to workspace
4. Ensure webhook has permission to post
